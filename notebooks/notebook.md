| Experiment | Demonstrates                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Local derivative shapes learning signal  |
| 2          | Depth causes gradient decay              |
| 3          | Population encoding increases robustness |
| 4          | Proper credit assignment                 |
| 5          | Reduction compresses information         |
| 6          | Symmetry breaking without noise          |
| 7          | Learning signals exist without learning  |
