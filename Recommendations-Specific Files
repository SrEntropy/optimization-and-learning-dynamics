How to visualize gradient norms with heatmaps:

Compute gradient norms

Arrange them in a 2D grid (depth × step, input × unit, etc.)

Color‑code magnitude

Why heatmaps:

They reveal structure in gradient flow

They show vanishing/exploding gradients instantly

They scale naturally to populations

They match biological visualization methods

They turn abstract math into intuitive patterns

📘 math_notes/ — Mathematical Ownership
This folder proves you understand the math before you code it.

What belongs here
Derivations of backpropagation

Jacobians for each operation (tanh, multiply, sum, etc.)

Notes on gradient flow, vanishing gradients, stability

Continuous‑time gradient flow vs discrete gradient descent

Any math you use to justify design decisions in core/

Small proofs or sanity checks (e.g., why sum broadcasts gradients)

How to implement it
Use Markdown with LaTeX

Keep each file focused on one concept

At the bottom of each file, add a section:
“Corresponding implementation: core/<file>.py”

Include diagrams or ASCII sketches if helpful

Purpose
This folder shows reviewers:

“I don’t just use autodiff — I understand the mathematics behind it.”

This is huge for robotics, control theory, and grad school.

🧠 core/ — You Understand Learning Mechanics
This is the engine room.
Everything here should be clean, minimal, and mathematically honest.

What belongs here
tensor.py or population_tensor.py

All primitive operations (add, mul, tanh, sum, etc.)

Backprop logic

Graph construction

Gradient accumulation

Utilities for gradient norms, Jacobians, etc.

How to implement it
Keep functions small and readable

Add docstrings referencing the math notes

No experiments, no models, no training loops

Only the mechanics of learning

Purpose
This folder proves:

“I can build the machinery of learning from scratch.”

This is the part robotics labs care about — correctness, stability, clarity.

🏗️ models/ — You Separate Abstraction From Math
This folder is where you build things using your engine.

What belongs here
A simple neuron class

A multi-layer perceptron

Population-based layers

Activation modules

Future: differentiable controllers, RNNs, spiking units

How to implement it
Models should call into core/, not reimplement math

Keep them modular

Each model gets its own file

Add a forward() method that builds the computation graph

Purpose
This folder shows:

“I know how to build abstractions on top of mathematical primitives.”

This is the skill robotics and ML engineers need.

🔬 experiments/ — You Test Hypotheses, Not Just Code
This is where you think like a scientist.

What belongs here
Experiments on vanishing gradients

Gradient norm heatmaps

Loss surface visualizations

Depth vs stability tests

Population coding experiments

Comparisons between gradient flow and gradient descent

Any test that answers a question, not just runs code

How to implement it
Each experiment should have:

Hypothesis

Method

Results

Interpretation

Figures (saved to figures/)

Purpose
This folder shows:

“I don’t just code — I investigate.”

This is what separates a coder from a researcher.

📓 notebooks/ — You Can Explain & Visualize
This is where you teach the material to yourself and others.

What belongs here
Interactive demos

Visualizations of gradient flow

Step-by-step walkthroughs

Plots of tanh derivatives

Heatmaps of gradient norms

Loss surface contour plots

Explanations of experiments

How to implement it
Use Jupyter notebooks

Mix code, math, and narrative

Keep them clean and readable

Link to figures generated in figures/

Purpose
This folder shows:

“I can communicate complex ideas clearly.”

This is essential for grad school, research, and robotics teams.

🖼️ figures/ — You Care About Communication
This is where your repo becomes visually memorable.

What belongs here
Heatmaps

Loss landscapes

Gradient norm plots

Architecture diagrams

Flowcharts of backprop

Any figure used in notebooks or experiments

How to implement it
Save all plots here

Use consistent naming

Keep raw images (PNG/SVG)

Optionally include a README.md describing each figure

Purpose
This folder shows:

“I understand that research is communication.”

Visual clarity is a superpower in robotics and NeuroAI.

🔥 Final Advice: How These Folders Work Together
Think of your repo as a pipeline:

math_notes/
You derive the math.

core/
You implement the math.

models/
You build abstractions using the math.

experiments/
You test hypotheses about the math.

notebooks/
You explain and visualize the math.

figures/
You communicate the math.

This structure is exactly how real research labs organize their work.
