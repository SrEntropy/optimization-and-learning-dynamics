#TODO: Minimal Tensor clas

"""
Tensors are container to store:
    shape: How many dimensions
    orientation: How axes relate
    transformation: How it behaves under operations
Tensors are the natural language of:
    Neula networks
    Physics
    Differential geometry
    Optimization
So, a tensor is a container for numbers witha structures
