# Population Dynamics (Placeholder Overview)

Population dynamics describe how quantities evolve over time using differential
equations. Examples include replicator dynamics, Lotka–Volterra systems, and
mean-field approximations of neural populations.

These systems are mathematically similar to:

- gradient flow  
- continuous-time learning rules  
- Neural ODEs  
- stability analysis via Jacobians  

I have not yet explored population dynamics in detail. I will return to this
topic if it becomes relevant to the scope of my three repos.

For now, the key idea is:

> Population dynamics are another example of learning as a dynamical system.

More detailed notes will be added in the future.
