 6. Add Theoretical Notes in Markdown (Rendered)
Your math_notes/ folder exists — good — but make them:
Easy to read

Linked from the README

Illustrated with equations and diagrams

Markdown is viewable right on GitHub and looks professional.

Math ↔ Code Correspondence
For each derivation in math_notes/, link to the exact code in core/ that implements it.
This tells reviewers you didn’t just read the math — you own it.
