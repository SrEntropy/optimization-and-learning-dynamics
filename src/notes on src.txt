Right now the code sits in loose folders (core/, models/). That’s fine, but converting it into a proper python package improves:
Import clarity


Testability


Reusability


Example:
src/learning_dynamics/
    core.py
    tensor.py
    optim.py
    models/

Then your notebooks and experiments import from that package.
This aligns with software engineering best practices seen in strong ML repos.
