Use Cases
Your PopulationTensor‑based autodiff engine isn’t just an academic exercise — it’s a foundation for the systems you’ll build next. These use cases highlight why this work matters and how it connects to robotics, learning dynamics, and your long‑term research goals.

1. Visualizations for Understanding Learning Dynamics
Modern learning systems are dynamical systems. Visual tools make these dynamics intuitive:

Loss surface contour plots  
Reveal curvature, local minima, and how gradient descent behaves in different regions.

Gradient norm heatmaps  
Show where gradients vanish or explode, making saturation and instability visible at a glance.

Dynamics vs. optimization comparisons  
Compare discrete gradient descent with continuous‑time gradient flow to understand stability and convergence.

These visualizations turn abstract math into patterns you can see, making learning behavior far more memorable and interpretable.

2. Math ↔ Code Correspondence
Every derivation in math_notes/ maps directly to an implementation in core/.

This explicit correspondence:

demonstrates mathematical maturity

shows reviewers you understand why each line of code exists

builds trust in the correctness of your autodiff engine

prepares you for research‑grade work where math and implementation must align

This is the kind of rigor expected in robotics, control theory, and graduate‑level machine learning.

3. Why This Matters for Robotics
Robotics is fundamentally about dynamics, control, and stable optimization. Your autodiff engine supports:

Differentiable control  
Gradients through controllers, policies, and dynamics models.

Trajectory optimization  
Many robotics algorithms rely on smooth, stable gradients.

State estimation and sensor fusion  
Population representations mirror how real robotic systems integrate noisy signals.

Understanding failure modes  
Vanishing/exploding gradients directly affect visuomotor policies and deep control networks.

By studying gradient flow, saturation, and stability now, you’re preparing for the exact mathematical challenges that appear in robot learning and differentiable simulators.
